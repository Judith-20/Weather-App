# Weather App

A simple weather application that allows users to get the current weather information for a city by entering its name. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Fetches current weather information for a city.
- Displays:
  - City name.
  - Temperature in Fahrenheit.
  - Humidity percentage.
  - Weather description.
  - Weather emoji based on the condition.
- Displays an error message if:
  - The city name is invalid.
  - The API request fails.

## Project Structure
